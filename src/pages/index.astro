        <h1>Welcome to my website</h1>
        <p>
          I'm Emilio José Degiovanni, a frontend developer specialized in
          Angular with over 22 years of experience in software development — 7
          years focused on frontend and 15 years as a fullstack developer. I'm
          based in Córdoba, Argentina, and currently work remotely for EPAM
          (USA) in the healthcare industry, where I contribute to migrating and
          improving Angular and Material applications, promoting best practices,
          performance, and testing.
        </p>

        <p>
          Throughout my career, I've led frontend teams on international
          projects, mentoring junior developers, building private component
          libraries from scratch, implementing micro frontend architectures with
          Webpack Module Federation, and ensuring high-quality standards through
          code reviews, CI/CD, and automated testing (unit, integration, and
          e2e). I've worked across industries such as healthcare, retail,
          logistics, fintech, and human resources.
        </p>

        <p>
          I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. I
          believe in teamwork, continuous learning, and that software
          development—like navigating a ship—requires planning, communication,
          and respect to reach the destination together.
