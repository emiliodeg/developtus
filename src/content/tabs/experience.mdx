Seasoned Frontend Engineer driven by clean architecture, performance, and scalability. With a strong foundation in software engineering and a deep focus on the Angular ecosystem, I excel at building robust, maintainable applications and guiding teams toward technical excellence. I thrive in remote, collaborative environments and bring a proactive, detail-oriented mindset to every project.

Below, you'll find a selection of companies where I've had the opportunity to contribute and grow as a professional.
