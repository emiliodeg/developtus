# Welcome to my website
        
I'm Emilio José Degiovanni, a frontend developer specialized in Angular with over 22 years of experience in software development — 7 years focused on frontend and 15 years as a fullstack developer. I'm based in Córdoba, Argentina, and [currently work remotely for EPAM](/experience#epam)
(USA) in the healthcare industry, where I contribute to migrating and improving Angular and Material applications, promoting best practices, performance, and testing.

Throughout my career, I've led frontend teams on international projects, mentoring junior developers, building private component libraries from scratch, implementing micro frontend architectures with Webpack Module Federation, and ensuring high-quality standards through
code reviews, CI/CD, and automated testing (unit, integration, and e2e). I've worked across industries such as healthcare, retail, logistics, fintech, and human resources.

I'm passionate about writing clean, efficient, and scalable code. I believe in teamwork, continuous learning, and that software development—like navigating a ship—requires planning, communication, and respect to reach the destination together.
