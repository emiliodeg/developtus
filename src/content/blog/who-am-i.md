I'm going to try to put my story into words for those who don't know me, or for those who want to understand what it's like to live as a systems engineer, developer, programmer, etc., in a highly competitive world.

In what follows, I’ll explain how my early years went—starting with my university education, and then my path as a self-taught learner. This way, I hope you’ll be able to understand what a software engineer does and what this professional lifestyle entails.
